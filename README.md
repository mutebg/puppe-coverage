# WebCoverage.app

[Checkout the app](https://WebCoverage.app)

Is super simple web app that shows used/un-used CSS and JS on your page.
The idea is to quickly check unused CSS/JS on multiply pages in different screensizes.

The app is based on [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and uses build in Chrome coverage report. For better examination checkout how to do it in Chrome https://youtu.be/4mx1m7UbBR0?t=9 or just use puppeteer to write own script.
